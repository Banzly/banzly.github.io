Programming (sometimes referred to as coding) is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer software. It involves using a programming language to create instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are typically organized into algorithms and data structures that perform specific tasks or solve particular problems. Programming is an essential skill in today's digital age, as it underpins everything from mobile apps and websites to complex software systems and artificial intelligence.

Programming enables so many things in our lives. Here are some examples :

* When you browse a website to find information, contact a service provider, or make a purchase, programming allows you to interact with the site’s on-page elements, such as sign-up or purchase buttons, contact forms, and drop-down menus

* The programming behind a mobile app can make it possible for you to order food, book a rideshare service, track your fitness, access media, and more with ease. 

* Programming helps businesses operate more efficiently through different software for file storage and automation and video conferencing tools to connect people globally, among other things. 

* Space exploration is made possible through programming



Here are some programming languages ​​and their definitions:

* Python

`Python` is an easy-to-learn and powerful high-level interpretive programming language. Python is often used in web development, data analytics, artificial intelligence and general software development.

* Java 

`Java` is a popular and widely used object-oriented programming language for building web, desktop, and mobile applications. Java uses a syntax similar to C++ and has the ability to run on multiple platforms.

* JavaScript

 `JavaScript` is a script-based programming language that is widely used to create interactive effects in modern websites and web applications. JavaScript can also be used to develop backend applications using platforms such as Node.js.

* C#

 `C#` is a modern programming language developed by Microsoft. C# is widely used for the development of desktop, web, and mobile applications and games.

* PHP

 `PHP` is a server-side programming language specially designed for creating dynamic and interactive websites. PHP works well with MySQL and is often used in CMS (Content Management System) development such as WordPress or Drupal.

* Ruby

 `Ruby` is a dynamic and interpretive programming language that is easy to learn and very flexible. Ruby is often used in web development and has popular web frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.

* Swift

 `Swift` is a modern programming language developed by Apple for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. Swift is easy to understand and focuses on simplicity and security.

 Types of programming languages
While hundreds of programming languages (if not thousands) exist, and there are many ways to classify them, they typically can be grouped into five main categories:

* Procedural programming languages

* Functional programming languages

* Object-oriented programming languages

* Scripting languages

* Logic programming languages
