# What Is Docker?

`Docker` is a powerful tool used for developing, packaging, and deploying applications efficiently. Docker is a container management service. Docker was released in 2013. It is open-source and available for different platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux. Docker is quickly shipping, testing, and deploying code. So that it reduces your delay between writing code and running it in production. You can create self-contained environments known as containers. That can run consistently on different platforms.

You need to install the Docker engine on your computer or device. The Docker engine allows you to create and manage docker containers, docker images, docker hub, docker desktop, etc.

In this Docker Tutorial, you’ll learn all the basic to advanced concepts like Docker installation, Docker container, Docker commands, Docker run, Docker images, Docker compose, Docker engine, Docker networking, etc.

# Why to learn Docker?

`Docker` can help you develop, package, and deploy applications more efficiently while reducing costs and resources. It also provides benefits such as consistency, portability, security, and version control. As a student, learning Docker can help you gain valuable skills and knowledge that can be useful in your future career as a developer or system administrator. There are many online resources available to help you learn Docker, including tutorials, courses, and documentation.

# Features of Docker

*  reduces the size of development by providing a smaller part of the OS via containers.
* It is easier to work on the same project by different teams with the help of Containers.
* Docker containers can be deployed anywhere, on any physical, or virtual machines and on the cloud.
* Docker containers are lightweight so, it becomes east to scale them.

# Advantages of Docker

* Docker uses less memory.
* The full operating system is not required to run an application.
* Containers run faster than the other Virtual Machines.
It is lightweight.
* It allows us to use a remote repository to share your containers with other teams.
* To reduce the risks, it uses dependencies.

# Disadvantages of Docker

* Complexity will increase due to layering.
* It is difficult to manage a large number of containers.
* For an application that needs better graphics, Docker is not suitable for it.
* Cross-platform compatibility is not allowed.

# How Does Docker Work?

`Docker` works via a Docker engine that is composed of two key elements: a server and a client; and the communication between the two is via REST API. The server communicates the instructions to the client. On older Windows and Mac systems, you can take advantage of the Docker toolbox, which allows you to control the Docker engine using Compose and Kitematic.

Now that we have learned about Docker, it's advantages, and how it works, our next focus in this getting started with docker tutorial is to learn the various components of Docker.

# Components of Docker

There are four components that we will discuss in this getting started with docker tutorial:

* Docker client and server 
* Docker image 
* Docker registry 
* Docker container

# Docker Container

A `Docker container` is a lightweight and executable package of software. It includes everything used to run an application, code, libraries, and dependencies. You don’t need to allocate any memory for the application. It can automatically generate space according to the requirements.

# Docker Client and Server 

`Docker Client and Server` is a command-line-instructed solution that allows users to issue commands from the terminal on their Mac or Linux system to the Docker daemon. The Docker daemon is a server that interacts with the operating system and performs services. To trigger and start the process, users need to use the Dockered command within their Docker daemon.  `Docker image` is a template that contains instructions for the Docker container, written in YAML, which stands for Yet Another Markup Language.

# Docker Image

The `Docker image` is built within the YAML file and hosted as a file in the Docker registry. It has four layers of instructions: From, Pull, Run and CMD. The From command creates a layer based on Ubuntu, and then adds files from the Docker repository to the base command. Pull adds files from the Docker repository, Run builds the container, and CMD specifies which command to run within the container. Each new container adds a new layer with new images within the Docker environment, so you can create your own separate read-write instructions within each layer. If you delete a layer, the layer above it will also get deleted.

# Docker Registry

`Docker Registry` is a repository of Docker images that can be easily stored and shared. To start managing a registry, one can use the publicly accessible Docker hub registry, or create their own registry for their own use internally. The commands used to connect the registry are Push and Pull. Push is used to push a new container environment from a local manager node to the Docker registry, and PullL is used to retrieve new clients (Docker image) created from the Docker registry. Push allows one to take a new command and push it to the registry.

# Docker Desktop

`Docker Desktop` is a free, easy-to-install, downstream application for a Mac or Windows environment that allows developers to build and share containerized applications and microservices. It consists of Docker Engine, Docker Compose, Docker CLI client, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. Docker Engine is the client-server technology used to build and run containers, while Docker Desktop is a free application that bundles together numerous Docker resources.

# Install Docker Desktop on Windows

Double-click `Docker Desktop Installer.exe` to run the installer.

If you haven’t already downloaded the installer (Docker Desktop Installer.exe), you can get it from `Docker Hub`. It typically downloads to your Downloads folder, or you can run it from the recent downloads bar at the bottom of your web browser.

When prompted, ensure the Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V option on the Configuration page is selected or not depending on your choice of backend.

If your system only supports one of the two options, you will not be able to select which backend to use.

Follow the instructions on the installation wizard to authorize the installer and proceed with the install.

When the installation is successful, click Close to complete the installation process.

If your admin account is different to your user account, you must add the user to the docker-users group. Run Computer Management as an administrator and navigate to Local Users and Groups > Groups > docker-users. Right-click to add the user to the group. Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
