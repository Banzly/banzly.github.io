hello my name is banz, this is about me. My activity is playing the computer outside of that I also like to play soccer, maybe this looks out of sync because when I was young I didn't touch the computer at all, I don't even know computers. From the virus of a hacker, I am motivated to look for security because something we have to equip is to protect ourselves, from viral cybercrimes. making myself curious about it, but...??wait. it's not my intention to be evil, but just curious to learn so I don't lie easily. after I searched for information I found a learning path that is cyber security and yeah... this is my hobby now and my notes hopefully make you excited to learn, good luck.
