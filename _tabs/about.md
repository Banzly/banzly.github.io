My name is BanZ. I am a college student who is passionate about technology and likes to explore new things. My main activities are playing Machine and programming.

Long story short in 2022 I reflected on myself. how can I protect others, if I can't protect myself. That's when I started learning Cyber Security, then I tried to join the community on my campus. honestly, at the time of the competition to enter the community I took 3 days because I didn't have basic coding or anything. and I asked my friends how this concept was done? there was no answer from them, I stopped asking and studied for 7 months. At one time I applied for an internship at an instantasi, I wanted to be like them,. in 2023 I was notified by someone to continue the test, at the time of the test I only surrendered to God. According to my intention in the learning process. 

God, listen to my prayer.
The acceptance of myself in a company is a process where prayer and effort during that time, it is not easy for me to go through this process alone.  I want to give my best to someone who has trusted me during my time here, Thank you to Lead, HR and my seniors who have given me a lot of experience. 

One of my promises to God, I want to help people if I can with the knowledge that I understand and can be useful to others.
